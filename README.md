### Evaluation

The autoencoders are trained using MSE and L1. To evaluate our trained dictionaries, we also report the subsequent statistics: 
- L0 norm: average number of non-zero features in each activation
- Loss Recovered: replace activations with the reconstructed activations in the forward pass
